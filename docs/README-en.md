## **Overview**
[Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) is an extremely powerful distributed **messaging platform**. However, it can be challenging to understand how it works if you're not familiar with its key concepts. The **goal** of this project is to <u>simplify learning Kafka</u> by using a fun and easy-to-understand analogy with trains and railways 🚂 — making the concepts so clear that even a child could grasp them.

The series **[Simplifying Kafka](TODO)** (🎥 <u>available on YouTube</u>) explores, episode by episode, how each part of Kafka works, explaining concepts like **producers**, **consumers**, **brokers**, **partitions**, **offsets**, and much more — all in a simplified and accessible way. 😉

## **Episodes**
Each video is dedicated to a fundamental aspect of Kafka, using the railway analogy to make understanding easier. Here are the topics covered:

## **Technologies Used**
- **Java**: Main language for implementing the Kafka example.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework to simplify development.
- **Apache Kafka**: Distributed messaging platform.
- **Docker**: To streamline local execution with Kafka images.

---

## **Additional Tools**
The project includes a `docker-compose.yml` file that uses various tools to run Kafka locally. Below are the official links for each tool:

- 🔗 **[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org)**: Distributed messaging platform for real-time data transmission.
- 🔗 **[Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org)**: Coordination service for managing brokers and Kafka metadata.
- 🔗 **[Kafdrop](https://github.com/obsidiandynamics/kafdrop)**: Web interface for monitoring topics, partitions, messages, and consumer groups.

## **How to Use**
This project accompanies the **"Simplifying Kafka"** video series.  Each video  covers a different aspect of the platform, using simple analogies to explain complex concepts. The example code is available for reference and can be adapted as needed.
